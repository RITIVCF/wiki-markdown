'''InterVarsity Christian Fellowship''' (IV) is a vibrant campus ministry that establishes and advances witnessing communities of students and faculty. We minister to students and faculty through small group Bible studies, large gatherings on campus, leadership training, thoughtful discipleship and life-changing conferences and events.

==Why the Campus?==

Today’s university shapes tomorrow’s leaders. In the university, women and men are encouraged to pursue truth, often without regard for God, and to pursue personal goals, often without concern for a higher purpose.
InterVarsity longs to see education lead to a lifetime of Christian worship and service. We believe that when students and faculty are transformed by the gospel of Jesus Christ, their campus is transformed, and ultimately society as a whole comes to more closely reflect the priorities of the kingdom of God. That is why we invest ourselves in the lives of students and faculty, wherever they are on their spiritual journey.

==Here at RIT==
Here at RIT
Our chapter of InterVarsity longs to demonstrate this goal on the RIT campus. We seek to interact with the diverse population on campus and to show the love of Christ to everyone around us. Two ways in which we interact with the campus are through Large Group and Small Groups.

==Large Group==
Large Group is where we gather as a whole chapter for worship and to listen to a talk relevant to our lives. If you want to become part of our community, you should definitely come to large group! After the main event, we always have special after events which range from movie nights to rock climbing at the red barn. Come for a great night of fellowship!

Beneath the Stuffing: Do you find yourself complaining often or being more thankful? Explore the importance of thanksgiving at '''Large Group in Gosnell 1250 at 7:00 PM!'''
==Small Group==
Join a Small Group! Below are the list of the Small groups that you may be interested in. Please take some time and explore the different groups. These Small Groups will allow you to get to know a smaller community of Christians and non-Christians and explore the unanswered questions together with people who have some real experience.
